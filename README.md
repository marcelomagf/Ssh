Ssh
===

Simple hack/perl script to make easy to manage several ssh connections configurations

The configuration file ``Ssh_hosts.txt``, by default,  must be in the same directory as the script ``Ssh.pl``

It is a good ideia to alias Ssh.pl to 's' in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile``: ``alias s='/path/to/Ssh.pl';``

Usage:

``
Ssh.pl hostname
``

or

``
Ssh.pl number
``
