Ssh
===

Simple hack/perl script to make easy to manage several ssh connection configurations

The configuration file `Ssh_hosts.conf`, by default,  must be in the same directory as the script `Ssh.pl`

It is a good ideia to alias Ssh.pl to 's' in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`: `alias s='/path/to/Ssh.pl';`

Usage:

`
Ssh.pl [[hostname]]
`
or

`
Ssh.pl number_of_host
`
